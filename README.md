# üöó Car Price Analysis ‚Äî Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores and analyzes automobile data to identify the key variables that influence car prices.  
It was developed as part of IBM's **Data Analysis with Python** course and expanded with additional correlation and visualization steps.

---

## üß© Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explore numerical and categorical features related to car price  
- Run descriptive statistical analysis  
- Visualize relationships between variables  
- Group and summarize data using pivot tables  
- Identify the most important predictors for car price

## üßÆ Dataset

The dataset used is provided by IBM:  
`https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Data%20files/automobileEDA.csv`
or data/automobileEDA.csv

It includes variables such as:
- **Length**
- **Width**
- **Curb-weight**
- **Engine-size**
- **Horsepower**
- **City-mpg**
- **Highway-mpg**
- **Wheel-base**
- **Bore**
- **Drive-wheels** *(categorical)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DenisNaumov7777/car-price-analysis.git
cd car-price-analysis



Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Alternatively, run directly in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

üìä Project Workflow
1. Importing and Exploring the Data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/automobileEDA.csv')
df.head()

2. Data Types and Summary Statistics
df.dtypes
df.describe()
df.describe(include=['object'])

3. Correlation Analysis
df[['engine-size', 'price']].corr()
sns.regplot(x="engine-size", y="price", data=df)

4. Boxplots for Categorical Variables
sns.boxplot(x="drive-wheels", y="price", data=df)
sns.boxplot(x="body-style", y="price", data=df)

5. Pivot Tables
grouped = df[['drive-wheels','body-style','price']].groupby(['drive-wheels','body-style'], as_index=False).mean()
pivot = grouped.pivot(index='drive-wheels', columns='body-style')
pivot.fillna(0, inplace=True)

6. Heatmap Visualization
plt.pcolor(pivot, cmap='RdBu')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()

7. Pearson Correlation Coefficients
from scipy import stats
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['horsepower'], df['price'])
print(f"Pearson Correlation: {pearson_coef:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.3f}")

üìà Results and Conclusions

The following variables showed strong correlations with car price:

Variable	Pearson Coefficient	Relationship
Engine-size	0.87	Strong positive
Curb-weight	0.84	Strong positive
Horsepower	0.81	Strong positive
Width	0.76	Strong positive
Length	0.70	Moderate positive
City-mpg	-0.68	Strong negative
Highway-mpg	-0.69	Strong negative

Key categorical predictor:

drive-wheels significantly affects car price.

üß† Key Insights

Cars with larger engine size and curb weight tend to have higher prices.

Better fuel efficiency (highway-mpg, city-mpg) is associated with lower prices.

Drive-wheel type (RWD, FWD, 4WD) influences pricing distribution significantly.
